What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs using Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use, highly efficient, and developer-friendly. FastAPI allows you to build APIs quickly with minimal code while leveraging the benefits of Python's type system for validation and documentation.

Key Features:
High Performance: Built on Starlette and Pydantic, ensuring speed comparable to NodeJS and Go.
Automatic Documentation: Generates Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation automatically.
Type Validation: Leverages Python type hints for data validation and serialization.
Asynchronous Support: Designed for asynchronous programming, making it ideal for modern web development.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up a FastAPI project:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.7+ installed on your machine.
A virtual environment tool like venv or conda (optional but recommended).
Steps to Install:
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
Install FastAPI and a Web Server: Use pip to install FastAPI and uvicorn (a high-performance ASGI server for serving FastAPI apps).

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn
Verify Installation: Create a simple main.py file:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --reload
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000. You should see the JSON response: {"message": "Hello, World!"}.
